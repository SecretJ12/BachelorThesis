This chapter will look at the schemas used to define running time functions.
We start by first looking at non-curried first-order functions.
Afterward, we extend this schema for higher-order functions and continue by allowing curried functions.
All schemas count the number of function calls made.
Also, we are only interested in the time complexity and, therefore, ignore constants.
