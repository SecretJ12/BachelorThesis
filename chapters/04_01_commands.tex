The implementation provides three commands.
The command $\texttt{define\_time\_fun}$ should mainly be used to convert a function.
It accepts the name of the function as arguments and optionally takes function equations after the keyword $\texttt{equations}$.
The full schema is shown in listing \ref{lst:cmds}.

The command tries to proof the termination automatically.
Details on the proof can be found in chapter \ref{chapter:termination}.
If the automatic proof takes to much time or even fails, the command $\texttt{define\_time\_function}$ can be used.
The schema is equal to $\texttt{define\_time\_fun}$.
Proofing termination for it works just as for the $\texttt{function}$ command by using $\texttt{termination}$.

The translation schema converts zero functions differently, see chapter \ref{chapter:impl_schema}.
Listing \ref{lst:primitive} shows all the functions, that are marked zero by default.
With the command $\texttt{define\_time\_0}$ you can mark more functions as zero.

To convert mutual recursive functions, you need to provide all all depending functions.
This cannot be used to convert multiple not already mutual recursive functions at once.

\begin{lstlisting}[float,label=lst:primitive,caption=Functions primitive by default,mathescape=true]
  +, -, *, /, div, <, $\le$, Not, $\land$, $\lor$, =, Num.numeral_class.numeral
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[float,label=lst:cmds,caption=Schema of implemented command]
  define_time_fun {NameOfFunction}+ [equations {thms list}]
  define_time_function {NameOfFunction}+ [equations {thms list}]
  define_time_0 {NameOfFunction}
\end{lstlisting}

By default timing functions will be registered with the prefix ``$\texttt{T\_}$''.
If you need to change this behaviour the configuration variable $\texttt{time\_prefix}$ can be adjusted.
Most of the time this should be not be changed to avoid confusion and incompatibilities.

The converter will try to register the function without sequential mode first.
This is the default of the $\texttt{function}$ command.
The behaviour is chosen as it avoids differences between the original and the timing function,
which would create problems for the autoamtic termination proof in some cases.
If this fails the converter falls back to sequential modde.
A warning is shown in the output.
