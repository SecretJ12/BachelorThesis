\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:impl}

The main work of this thesis was the implementation of an automatic converter of functions to their running time function for Isabelle.
The converter is restricted to non-curried functions.
This chapter explains the usage and the behaviour of the automatic converter.
Section \ref{chapter:commands} shows the form of the added commands.
In the next section \ref{chapter:impl_schema} we take a look at the conversion schema used by the converter.
In order to provide a pleasing user experience there exists an automatic termination proof for the running time function.
The details on this can be found in section \ref{chapter:termination}.
As defining running time functions can get quite complicated, there exist some restrictions in order to keep the implemetation readable.
Those restrictions are described in section \ref{chapter:restrictions}.
