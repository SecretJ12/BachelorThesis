\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:impl}

The main work of this thesis was the implementation of an automatic converter of functions to their running time function for Isabelle.
In order to keep the converter readable, it is restricted to non-curried functions.
The implementation works for the newest developer version of Isabelle and will be part of the Isabelle distribution.

This chapter explains the usage and the behavior of the automatic converter.
Section \ref{chapter:commands} shows the form of the added commands.
In the next section \ref{chapter:impl_schema}, we look at the conversion schema used by the converter.
In order to provide a pleasing user experience, an automatic termination proof exists for the running time function.
The details can be found in section \ref{chapter:termination}.
Defining running time functions can get complicated, so some restrictions exist to keep the implementation readable.
Section \ref{chapter:restrictions} describes those restrictions.
